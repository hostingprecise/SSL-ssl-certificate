"Why do I need SSL? What will it do for me?‚Äù This is an important question for anyone involved in the web to understand. SSL creates an encrypted connection between your web server and your visitors' web browser allowing for private information to be transmitted without the problems of eavesdropping, data tampering, or message forgery. SSL is the backbone of our secure Internet and it protects your sensitive information as it travels across the world. SSL is an industry standard and is used by millions of websites for the protection of their online transactions with their customers. It keeps the Internet from being ruled by anarchists and criminals and provides many direct benefits to you and your customers.
